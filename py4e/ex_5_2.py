# Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the numberl

largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    num = input("Enter a number: ")
    if num == "done" :
        break
    try:
        num = int(num)
    except:
        print("Invalid input")
        continue

    if largest is None :
        smallest = num
        largest = num
    elif largest > num :
        if smallest > num :
            smallest = num
    elif largest < num :
        largest = num
